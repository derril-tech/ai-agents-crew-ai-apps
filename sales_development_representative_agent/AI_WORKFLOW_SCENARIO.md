Subject: Helping InnovateCorp Scale Engineering Without the Headache

Hi Michael,

I noticed InnovateCorp's impressive growth trajectory and recent Series B funding. 
Congratulations on the $25M raise! 

As you scale your engineering team from 500 to 1000+ employees, I'm sure you're 
facing the same challenges we've helped other fast-growing tech companies solve:
- Manual onboarding processes eating up 20+ hours per hire
- Inconsistent sales processes across expanding teams
- Difficulty maintaining quality as you scale

We recently helped a similar company (500‚Üí800 engineers) reduce their sales 
onboarding time by 60% while improving conversion rates by 25% using our 
AI-powered sales automation platform.

Would you be interested in a 15-minute call to discuss how we could help 
InnovateCorp achieve similar results? I'd love to share some specific insights 
about your industry and team structure.

Best regards,
Sarah Johnson
Sales Development Representative
TechCorp Inc.
```
