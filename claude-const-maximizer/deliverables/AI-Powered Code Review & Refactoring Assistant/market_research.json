For professional developers, these tools act as productivity multipliers, automating mundane tasks and enabling focus on complex problem-solving. For citizen developers, they lower the barrier to entry, allowing business professionals to create simple applications without extensive training. [...] The AI coding assistant market is witnessing rapid growth, with establishedtechgiants and emerging players entering the fray. GitHub Copilot, backed by Microsoft, has set a high standard, but competitors like Tabnine and Amazon Q Developer are making significant strides.\n\nGoogle has also made a significant entry into this market recently with Jules, an experimental coding assistant aimed at enhancing developer workflows. [...] AI-powered coding assistants have come a long way from simple code-completion tools to sophisticated platforms capable of generating entire code blocks, debugging, and optimizing code. Early iterations primarily provided auto-complete features, akin to predictive text on smartphones. Today, these tools leverage advanced Large Language Models (LLM) to understand context and provide nuanced code suggestions. As a result, AI coding assistants can now:",
