Include modular components for easy maintenance.\n- **Backend**: FastAPI with PostgreSQL. Implement RESTful API for CRUD operations. Utilize JWT for user authentication and Redis for caching. Implement error handling with logging for debugging.\n- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization.\n\n## UI/UX Design Specifications\n- **Design Trends**: Minimalistic design, clean layouts, and mobile-first approach using soft pastel color schemes.\n- **Common UX Patterns**: Dashboard with drag-and-drop functionality, real-time collaboration, and guided content generation.\n\n## Implementation Plan and Timeline\n- **Phase 1 (Month 1)**: Requirement gathering and UI/UX design.\n- **Phase 2 (Month 2)**: Frontend and backend development.\n- **Phase 3 (Month 3)**: Integration and testing.\n- **Phase 4 (Month 4)**: Deployment and launch.\n\n## Success Metrics and Validation\n- Track user engagement (views, shares), content performance, and application uptime. Aim for a target engagement lift of 30% within the first 6 months post-launch.\n\n## Deployment and Launch Strategy\n- Utilize cloud services for deployment. Implement continuous integration and development strategies with regular user feedback loops to refine features post-launch.\n\n## Additional Claude Optimization Elements\n- **Prompt Optimization**: \n  - CRUD Operations: \"Create new content for {title}, type: {type}, tone: {tone}.\"\n  - Feedback Loop: \"What improvements can be made based on user feedback on {content_id}?\"\n- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error management ensuring clear user feedback on application faults.\n\nThis document offers Claude a clear, coherent foundation to integrate into application development, guiding him to produce a complete application within 3-5 interaction prompts efficiently. The 4-document weapon strategy underpins this approach while maintaining a focus on user needs and thorough specification adherence for optimal AI application outcomes.",
