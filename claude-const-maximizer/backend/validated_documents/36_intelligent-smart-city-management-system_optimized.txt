UI/UX Design Specifications
• Design Trends: Minimalist approach with intuitive navigation and accessibility.
• Color Scheme: Professional palette with soft blues and greens, prioritizing legibility and user engagement.
• User Experience: Expectation of immediate results, high accuracy, and simple integration.
Implementation Plan and Timeline
Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Finalize requirements and set up development environment.
Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Develop frontend components and initial backend API.
Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6): Integration of APIs and testing.
Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8): User testing and deployment preparation.
Deployment and Launch Strategy
• Utilize Docker for containerization, ensuring configuration for different environments.
• Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
• Launch following thorough testing and user feedback integration.
Claude Optimization Focus
• Structure this document for easy comprehension by Claude.
• Ensure all technical specifications are clear and actionable.
• Define implementation steps and clear success criteria, aiming for 3-5 prompts to achieve application readiness.
Proposed Prompt Templates for Claude
Content Generation Request:
`json
{
"prompt": "Generate a blog post on {topic}, targeted at {audience} with {desired_tone}.",
"constraints": {
"output_length": "200-800 words",
"formatting": "Markdown"
}
}
`
Error Handling:
Handle potential errors and request for feedback to improve future prompts.
Performance Evaluation:
After content generation, assess coherence and relevance to ensure alignment with user needs.
By incorporating these strategies and structures, we will produce a Claude optimization that yields high-quality content applications in minimal prompts, enhancing user experience and engagement across the target market.
